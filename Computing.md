## Computing's role in course

Time series analysis is heavily computational.  There are some theoretical concepts to understand, but even these benefit from application or statistical testing using the computer.  Therefore a large amount of your time will be spent analyzing either real or simulated data.  

All of you are expected to have taken a first-year computer science class.  Beyond that, student experience varies widely at UVic Physics, with some students having taken more formal computer training, others having worked in a co-op position that gave you experience with computational data analysis.  The upshot is that the computing component of the course will be a lot harder for some students than others.  Fortunately, there are lots of online resources to help.  I use http://google.com pretty steadily while working on coding problems.
