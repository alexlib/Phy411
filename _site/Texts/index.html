  <p>There is no course textbook.  </p>

<p>The course was previously taught from  <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/Random_Data.html?id=iu7pq6_vo3QC&amp;redir_esc=y">Bendat and Piersol</a>, 4th edition, 2010.  Older versions should be fine, but you&#39;ll have to dig a bit if equation
numbers have changed etc.  </p>

<p>Bendat and Piersol is a relatively formal statistics text, which is
helpful for clarifying concepts after they have been thought about a
bit.  Also, such explanations can sometimes be missed during class, or
not explained properly by the professor, so it is nice to have a
formal text to fall back on.  </p>

<p>It does not do almost anything on filtering, which we really will have
to cover as well.  Fortunately, there are plenty of online resources. </p>

<p><strong>Other texts</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I often refer to
<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Data-Analysis-Methods-Physical-Oceanography/dp/0444507574">Emery and Thompson</a> simply because it is a compendium of the most
commonly used techniques in my field.  They also have a lot of
real-world examples.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nr.com/">Press et. al.</a>, (Numerical Recipes) is the definitive resource for
basic computing algorithms.  Of course, a lot of these algorithm&#39;s
are available as libraries for common languages, so perhaps not as
useful as it was 20 years ago.<br></li>
<li>A text that is at a slightly lower level, but has <em>lots</em> of
tutorials (in Matlab!) is by Trauth, &quot;MATLAB recipes for earth
sciences&quot; and is available online at
the library:  <a href="http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=1287&amp;recCount=25&amp;recPointer=0&amp;bibId=2042767">Link</a>.  It has very little derivation, and no
discussion of confidence intervals or error analysis, and
therefore is a bit beneath this course, but the logical layout is
nice. </li>
