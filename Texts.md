There is no course textbook.  

The course was previously taught from  [Bendat and Piersol](http://books.google.ca/books/about/Random_Data.html?id=iu7pq6_vo3QC&redir_esc=y), 4th edition, 2010.  Older versions should be fine, but you'll have to dig a bit if equation
numbers have changed etc. 

Apparently this is now available online!  [Link](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781118032428) 

Bendat and Piersol is a relatively formal statistics text, which is
helpful for clarifying concepts after they have been thought about a
bit.  Also, such explanations can sometimes be missed during class, or
not explained properly by the professor, so it is nice to have a
formal text to fall back on.  

It does not do almost anything on filtering, which we  will cover as well.  Fortunately, there are plenty of online resources. 


**Other texts**

  - I often refer to
    [Emery and Thomson](http://www.amazon.ca/Data-Analysis-Methods-Physical-Oceanography/dp/0444507574) simply because it is a compendium of the most
    commonly used techniques in my field.  They also have a lot of
    real-world examples.  
  - [Press et. al.](http://www.nr.com/), (Numerical Recipes) is the definitive resource for
    basic computing algorithms.  Of course, a lot of these algorithm's
    are available as libraries for common languages, so perhaps not as
    useful as it was 20 years ago.  
  - A text that is at a slightly lower level, but has *lots* of
    tutorials (in Matlab!) is by Trauth, "MATLAB recipes for earth
    sciences" and is available online at
    the library:  [Link](http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?searchId=1287&recCount=25&recPointer=0&bibId=2042767).  It has very little derivation, and no
    discussion of confidence intervals or error analysis, and
    therefore is a bit beneath this course, but the logical layout is
    nice. 
  - An excellent set of notebooks, similar to what I am attempting with this course are [Python for Signal Processing](https://github.com/unpingco/Python-for-Signal-Processing/blob/master/README.md).  I found this after I started, but a lot of it is relevant to this class.
